## Summary

Welcome to `f3dasm`, a Python package for data-driven design and analysis of structures and materials.


## Authorship

* Current created and developer: [M.P. van der Schelling](https://github.com/mpvanderschelling/) (M.P.vanderSchelling@tudelft.nl)

The Bessa research group at TU Delft is small... At the moment, we have limited availability to help future users/developers adapting the code to new problems, but we will do our best to help!

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to follow the [installation instructions](https://bessagroup.github.io/f3dasm/general/gettingstarted.html).
