  abstract   = {Rare events, especially those that could potentially negatively impact society, often require humans’ decision-making responses. Detecting rare events can be viewed as a prediction task in data mining and machine learning communities. As these events are rarely observed in daily life, the prediction task suffers from a lack of balanced data. In this paper, we provide an in depth review of rare event detection from an imbalanced learning perspective. Five hundred and seventeen related papers that have been published in the past decade were collected for the study. The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields.},

  abstract = {Composite consisting of polypropylene reinforced with short sisal fibers were prepared by melt-mixing and solution-mixing methods. In the melt-mixing technique, mixing parameters were optimised by varying the mixing time, rotor speed and chamber temperature. A mixing time of 10 min, rotor speed of 50 rpm and a mixing temperature of 170°C were found to be the optimum mixing conditions. Tensile properties of melt-mixed and solution-mixed composites were compared. Under optimum mixing conditions melt-mixed composites showed better tensile properties than those of solution-mixed composites. The influence of fiber length, fiber loading and fiber orientation on the mechanical properties of PP/sisal composites has been evaluated. The fiber breakage and damage during melt-mixing were analysed from fiber-length distribution curves and optical photomicrographs. The effect of chemical treatment on the tensile properties of sisal/PP composites was investigated. Treatments with chemicals such as sodium hydroxide, maleic anhydride, urethane derivative of PPG, and permanganate were carried out to improve the bonding at the fiber/polymer interface. It has been observed that all the treatments enhanced the tensile properties of the composites considerably, but to varying degrees.},

The optimal population size takes a wide range of values, but, with one exception, scales sub-linearly with the problem dimension. The global optimum can be located in all but one function. The performance for locating the global optimum scales between linear and cubic with the problem dimension. In a comparison to state-of-the-art global search strategies the CMA evolution strategy achieves superior performance on multimodal, non-separable test functions without intricate parameter tuning.},

The framework is used to design ultra-thin carbon fiber deployable shells subjected to two bending conditions. Significant increases in the ultimate buckling loads are shown to be possible, with potential gains on the order of 100{\%} as compared to a previously proposed design. The key to this result is the existence of a large load reserve capability after the initial bifurcation point and well into the post-buckling range that can be effectively explored by the data-driven approach. The computational strategy here presented is general and can be applied to different problems in structural and materials design, with the potential of finding relevant designs within high-dimensional spaces.},

When the objective function is convex, we present two novel frameworks for "accelerating" descent methods, one in the style of Nesterov and the other in the style of Monteiro and Svaiter, using a single Lyapunov. Rescaled gradient descent can be accelerated under the same strong smoothness assumption using both frameworks. We provide several examples of strongly smooth loss functions in machine learning and numerical experiments that verify our theoretical findings. We also present several extensions of our novel Lyapunov framework, including deriving optimal universal tensor methods and extending our framework to the coordinate setting.},

This enables the evolution strategy (ES) to adapt the correct scaling of a given problem and also ensures invariance with respect to any rotation of the fitness function (or the coordinate system). Especially rotation invariance, here resulting directly from the coordinate system independent adaptation of the mutation distribution, is an essential feature of the ES with regard to its general applicability to complex fitness functions. Compared to previous work on this subject, the introduced formulation facilitates an interpretation of the resulting mutation distribution, making sensible manipulation by the user possible (if desired). Furthermore it enables a more effective control of the overall mutation variance (expected step length)},

Commonalities and differences to continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are analyzed. The aspects of reliability of the estimation, overall step size control, and independence from the coordinate system (invariance) become particularly important in small populations sizes. Consequently, performing the adaptation task with small populations is more intricate. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin/Heidelberg 2006.},

A side contribution of our work is also a generic analysis that can handle inexact proximal operators, providing new insights about the robustness of stochastic algorithms when the proximal operator cannot be exactly computed.},

abstract = {Designing future-proof materials goes beyond a quest for the best. The next generation of materials needs to be adaptive, multipurpose, and tunable. This is not possible by following the traditional experimentally guided trial-and-error process, as this limits the search for untapped regions of the solution space. Here, a computational data-driven approach is followed for exploring a new metamaterial concept and adapting it to different target properties, choice of base materials, length scales, and manufacturing processes. Guided by Bayesian machine learning, two designs are fabricated at different length scales that transform brittle polymers into lightweight, recoverable, and supercompressible metamaterials. The macroscale design is tuned for maximum compressibility, achieving strains beyond 94{\%} and recoverable strengths around 0.1 kPa, while the microscale design reaches recoverable strengths beyond 100 kPa and strains around 80{\%}. The data-driven code is available to facilitate future design and analysis of metamaterials and structures (https://github.com/mabessa/F3DAS).},

Unfortunately, this thought-provoking perspective is weakened by the fact that, in the worst case, the error between the algorithm steps and its ODE approximation grows exponentially with the number of iterations. In an attempt to encourage the use of continuous-time methods in optimization, we show that, if some additional regularity on the objective is assumed, the ODE representations of Gradient Descent and Heavy-ball do not suffer from the aforementioned problem, once we allow for a small perturbation on the algorithm initial condition. In the dynamical systems literature, this phenomenon is called shadowing. Our analysis relies on the concept of hyperbolicity, as well as on tools from numerical analysis.},

In this work, pecan (Carya illinoinensis) nutshell (NS) fiber and its structural components, holocellulose (HC) and acid insoluble lignin (AIL), were isolated, characterized and used as reinforcing fillers to manufacture poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based biocomposites. Thermal, morphological and mechanical properties of the prepared materials were analyzed. NS and HC acted as heterogeneous nucleating agents, potentially able to control PLA physical aging. Moreover, they significantly enhanced the viscoelastic response of PLA, mainly restricting the melt molecular mobility due to hydrodynamic effects and the formation of a three-dimensional particulate network. Flexural tests demonstrated that HC induced a 25{\%} increase in modulus compared to the plain polymer. AIL, conversely, conferred higher ductility to the PLA matrix producing an increase in stress and strain at break of 55{\%} and 65{\%}, respectively. Finally, all the biocomposites showed lower resilience with respect to plain PLA due to the lack of chemical adhesion between filler and matrix. These results emphasize the potential of NS as a source of reinforcing filler in polymer-based biocomposites.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract  = {Over the last decade, biopolymers have seen a sharp increase in their market share as an alternative to conventional oil-based plastic materials. Among them, degradable biopolymers are rarely employed, especially in the field of durable end-goods, because of their often limited chemical, mechanical and thermal behaviours. In contrast, stringent international regulations encourage the employment of low-impact materials in several manufacturing domains, with degradable polymers considered par excellence. In the present work, an innovative route to control the final properties of an extrusion-compounded, high-performance biocomposite composed of polylactic acid (PLA) reinforced with micro-lamellar talc is proposed. For this purpose, talc was first modified via surface reaction with organic (i.e., belonging to the class of polyisocyanates) or hybrid organic-inorganic (i.e., belonging to the class of organosilanes) compatibilizers, respectively. Custom-built formulations were then achieved by the dispersion of the pretreated micro-lamellar talc in commercial-grade PLA. The resulting compounds were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy. The experimental findings show that PLAs with different properties can be achieved as a result of chemical and physical interactions among the functional groups on the surface of the pretreated talc and the terminal groups of the PLA chains. These results are extremely promising for the achievement of innovative grades of PLAs suitable for melt processing and to ensure the greatly improved chemical inertness, thermal stability and mechanical strength of the resulting end-goods.},

However, vast optimization approaches in renewable energy applications have been widely used hitherto to aid decision-makings in mitigating the limitations of computations. This paper comprehensively reviews the generic steps of stochastic optimizations in renewable energy applications, from the modelling of the uncertainties and sampling of relevant information, respectively. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the stochastic optimization methods are highlighted. Moreover, notable optimization methods pertaining to the steps of stochastic optimizations are highlighted. The aim of the paper is to introduce the recent advancements and notable stochastic methods and trending of the methods going into the future of renewable energy applications. Relevant future research areas are identified to support the transition of stochastic optimizations from the traditional deterministic approaches. We concluded based on the surveyed literatures that the stochastic optimization methods almost always outperform the deterministic optimization methods in terms of social, technical, and economic aspects of renewable energy systems. Thus, this review will catalyse the effort in advancing the research of stochastic optimization methods within the scopes of renewable energy applications.},

  abstract  = {In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time-scales rang-ing from real-time operation to long-term plan-ning. This process often involves solving sim-ilar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under stringent time requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this solution process to directly learn the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need of solving computationally expensive large-scale paramet-ric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active con-straints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables more interpretable learning poli-cies, and inherently accounts for relevant safety constraints. Further, the number of relevant ac-tive sets is finite, which make them simpler ob-jects to learn. To learn the relevant active sets, we propose a streaming algorithm backed up by the-oretical results. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks of the Optimal Power Flow prob-lem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that this is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning al-gorithm to target.},

This is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, which is based on the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species, along with Levy flights random walks. Normally, the parameters of the cuckoo search are kept constant for certain duration, this results into decrease the efficiency of the algorithm. To make a deal with this issue, a proper strategy for tuning the cuckoo search parameters is to be defined. Cuckoos are fascinating birds, not only because of the beautiful sounds they can make but also because of their aggressive reproduction strategy. Some species such as the Ani and Guira cuckoos lay their eggs in host bird nest, and they may remove others eggs to increase the hatching probability of their own. In this paper, cuckoos behaviour {\&} their egg laying strategy in the nests of other host birds is explained.},

Intra-and inter-hybridizations of flax and silk fibres are applied to evaluate the effect on composite mechanical properties including tensile and flexural modulus and strength. The interface properties between the fibres and matrix are investigated using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Most importantly, falling weight impact experiments reveal that silks can effectively prevent crack propagation whereas flax fibres can greatly enhance the impact load. Our study could offer new solutions towards novel biocomposites with tailored modulus, strength and toughness properties based on natural biopolymer fibres.},

@article{Burke2013,
abstract = {Hyper-heuristics comprise a set of approaches that are motivated (at least in part) by the goal of automating the design of heuristic methods to solve hard computational search problems. An underlying strategic research challenge is to develop more generally applicable search methodologies. The term hyper-heuristic is relatively new; it was first used in 2000 to describe heuristics to choose heuristics in the context of combinatorial optimisation. However, the idea of automating the design of heuristics is not new; it can be traced back to the 1960s. The definition of hyper-heuristics has been recently extended to refer to a search method or learning mechanism for selecting or generating heuristics to solve computational search problems. Two main hyper-heuristic categories can be considered: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. The distinguishing feature of hyper-heuristics is that they operate on a search space of heuristics (or heuristic components) rather than directly on the search space of solutions to the underlying problem that is being addressed. This paper presents a critical discussion of the scientific literature on hyper-heuristics including their origin and intellectual roots, a detailed account of the main types of approaches, and an overview of some related areas. Current research trends and directions for future research are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

Biochar, a carbon rich and thermally stable material, derived from switchgrass under controlled pyrolysis was tested as a functional filler. The study aimed at investigating the impact of biochar and wood fiber in the presence of coupling agent (maleic anhydride) on the properties of bio-composites. The bio-composite physical, mechanical and thermal properties were characterized using microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that coupling agent is more compatible with wood flour than biochar. Addition of biochar reduced the moisture absorption and linear thermal expansion of filled bio-composites. It also improved the composites strength and moduli, showing a reinforcing nature of biochar. The TGA thermograms confirmed the improved stability of composites with biochar. Coupling agent was more effective in HDPE matrix reinforced by wood flour than biochar. Overall, this study demonstrated that biochar can be a good filler for improving dimensional stability, mechanical properties, and thermal stability of bio-composites.},

If there is poor diversity in the current population, then there is poor diversity in the subset of solutions selected from it and in the next generation that is created from it. Like many metaheuristics, EDAs can suffer from an autocatalytic process in which convergence begets more convergence. In Thresheld Convergence, convergence is 'held' back by a threshold function, and this new technique has been successfully applied to other metaheuristics to prevent autocatalytic convergence from cascading into premature convergence. In this paper, Thresheld Convergence is applied to Estimation Multivariate Normal Algorithm with a key difference: convergence is controlled in the parameter space instead of the search space. Computational results show that significant improvements can be achieved across a broad range of multimodal functions.},

Changes in chemical compositions of the untreated and treated fibers were monitored with Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy, while changes in the crystallinity index were studied via X-ray diffraction. The FTIR spectra and scanning electron microscope images corroborated the successful removal of amorphous portions from the Typha leaf fibers during alkali treatment, which resulted in an enhanced crystallinity index for alkali-treated fibers. The alkali-treated Typha fiber for 1 h showed the highest water contact angle of 87.5°, while the untreated composite showed the lowest contact angle. Typha fiber treated for 4 h had high tensile strength, Young's modulus, and elongation at break of 158 MPa, 1600 MPa, and 7{\%}, respectively. The results showed that there was a general increase in the interfacial shear strength of Typha fiber with epoxy resin and polyester resin with increased time. Both the mechanical properties and crystallinity index of the Typha leaf fibers increased with increased time of retting until 4 h, after which further alkaline retting resulted in decreased values.

abstract = {A new data-driven computational framework is developed to assist in the design and modeling of new material systems and structures. The proposed framework integrates three general steps: (1) design of experiments, where the input variables describing material geometry (microstructure), phase properties and external conditions are sampled; (2) efficient computational analyses of each design sample, leading to the creation of a material response database; and (3) machine learning applied to this database to obtain a new design or response model. In addition, the authors address the longstanding challenge of developing a data-driven approach applicable to problems that involve unacceptable computational expense when solved by standard analysis methods – e.g. finite element analysis of representative volume elements involving plasticity and damage. In these cases the framework includes the recently developed “self-consistent clustering analysis” method in order to build large databases suitable for machine learning. The authors believe that this will open new avenues to finding innovative materials with new capabilities in an era of high-throughput computing (“big-data”).},

  abstract = {Examination timetabling is one of the most important administrative activities that takes place in all academic institutions. In this paper, we present a critical discussion of the research on exam timetabling which has taken place in the last decade or so. This last ten years has seen a significantly increased level of research attention for this important area. There has been a range of insightful contributions to the scientific literature both in terms of theoretical issues and practical aspects. The main aim of this survey is to highlight the new trends and key research achievements that have been carried out in the last decade. We also aim to outline a range of relevant important research issues and challenges that have been generated by this body of work. We first define the problem and discuss previous survey papers. Within our presentation of the state-of-the-art methodologies, we highlight recent research trends including hybridisations of search methodologies and the development of techniques which are motivated by raising the level of generality at which search methodologies can operate. Summarising tables are presented to provide an overall view of these techniques. We also present and discuss some important issues which have come to light concerning the public benchmark exam timetabling data. Different versions of problem datasets with the same name have been circulating in the scientific community for the last ten years and this has generated a significant amount of confusion. We clarify the situation and present a re-naming of the widely studied datasets to avoid future confusion. We also highlight which research papers have dealt with which dataset. Finally, we draw upon our discussion of the literature to present a (non-exhaustive) range of potential future research directions and open issues in exam timetabling research. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {As the number of practical applications of discrete black-box metaheuristics is growing faster and faster, the benchmarking of these algorithms is rapidly gaining importance. While new algorithms are often introduced for specific problem domains, researchers are also interested in which general problem characteristics are hard for which type of algorithm. The W-Model is a benchmark function for discrete black-box optimization, which allows for the easy, fast, and reproducible generation of problem instances exhibiting characteristics such as ruggedness, deceptiveness, epistasis, and neutrality in a tunable way. We conduct the first large-scale study with the W-Model in its fixed-length single-objective form, investigating 17 algorithm configurations (including Evolutionary Algorithms and local searches) and 8372 problem instances. We develop and apply a machine learning methodology to automatically discover several clusters of optimization process runtime behaviors as well as their reasons grounded in the algorithm and model parameters. Both a detailed statistical evaluation and our methodology confirm that the different model parameters allow us to generate problem instances of different hardness, but also find that the investigated algorithms struggle with different problem characteristics. With our methodology, we select a set of 19 diverse problem instances with which researchers can conduct a fast but still in-depth analysis of algorithm performance. The best-performing algorithms in our experiment were Evolutionary Algorithms applying Frequency Fitness Assignment, which turned out to be robust over a wide range of problem settings and solved more instances than the other tested algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In this work, agave fibers were surface treated using maleated PLA (MAPLA) in order to increase the fiber content (from 10 up to 40{\%} wt.) in polylactic acid (PLA) biocomposites produced by rotational molding and to study the effect of the agave fiber and its treatment on the physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the biocomposites. This chemical modification between agave fibers and MAPLA was evaluated by FTIR spectroscopy. In general the results indicate that MAPLA surface treatment produces a more homogeneous morphology with lower interfacial gaps and overall porosity, especially at higher agave contents. This improved compatibility promoted better stress transfer leading to increased mechanical properties. For example, the tensile strength and modulus of treated fiber composites increased by up to 68{\%} (from 25 to 41 MPa) and 32{\%} (from 1.30 to 1.74 GPa) respectively, in comparison with untreated fiber composites. Fiber surface treatment also decreases hydrophilicity, lowering water absorption and diffusion coefficient. From thermo–mechanical analyses, the damping behavior of the biocomposites decreased with MAPLA treatment since a stronger interface is able to sustain higher stresses and dissipates less energy. Finally, the thermal stability was also improved as a result of better interfacial chemical bonding leading to a 12 °C increase in thermal stability (from 254 to 266 °C).},

@article{Xu2015,
abstract = {In designing microstructural materials systems, one of the key research questions is how to represent the microstructural design space quantitatively using a descriptor set that is sufficient yet small enough to be tractable. Existing approaches describe complex microstructures either using a small set of descriptors that lack sufficient level of details, or using generic high order microstructure functions of infinite dimensionality without explicit physical meanings. We propose a new machine learning-based method for identifying the key microstructure descriptors from vast candidates as potential microstructural design variables. With a large number of candidate microstructure descriptors collected from literature covering a wide range of microstructural material systems, a four-step machine learning-based method is developed to eliminate redundant microstructure descriptors via image analyses, to identify key microstructure descriptors based on structure-property data, and to determine the microstructure design variables. The training criteria of the supervised learning process include both microstructure correlation functions and material properties. The proposed methodology effectively reduces the infinite dimension of the microstructure design space to a small set of descriptors without a significant information loss. The benefits are demonstrated by an example of polymer nanocomposites optimization. We compare designs using key microstructure descriptors versus using empirically chosen microstructure descriptors as a demonstration of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing demand of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites in various engineering applications calls for accurate predictions of their mechanical behaviors. In this study, numerical methods to generate and simulate mechanical properties of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites are proposed. The microstructures of short flax fibres with different fibre length-to-diameter ratios are generated by algorithm taking fiber defects (e.g. kink band) and fiber bundles into account. Bidirectional flax fabric is generated and discretized by tetrahedron 4-node finite elements. A brittle material law for fibre defects and interfacial zones of fibre bundles is proposed. Flax short fibre/polypropylene and flax fabric/epoxy composites are modeled by a non-linear plasticity model considering an isotropic hardening law and non-local continuum damage mechanics. The numerical modelling results are compared with the experimental results of these composites. This study shows that the simulation can capture the main damage mechanisms of the composites such as fibre breakage initiated at the fiber defects, damage of polymer matrix and the fibre debonding at fibre/matrix interface accurately. In addition, the simulation results exhibit good agreements with the experimental results in the aspects of elastic properties and nonlinear tensile stress-strain behavior of the short fibre and fibre fabric reinforced polymer composites.},

This is in contrast to existing literature that typically assumes sub-Gaussian noise distributions for queries. Under the assumption that the unknown function belongs to the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) induced by a kernel, we first show that an adaptation of the well-known GP-UCB algorithm with reward truncation enjoys sublinear {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}O{\}}(T{\^{}}{\{}\backslashfrac{\{}2 + \backslashalpha{\}}{\{}2(1+\backslashalpha){\}}{\}}){\$} regret even with only the {\$}(1+\backslashalpha){\$}-th moments, {\$}\backslashalpha \backslashin (0,1]{\$}, of the reward distribution being bounded ({\$}\backslashtilde{\{}O{\}}{\$} hides logarithmic factors). However, for the common squared exponential (SE) and Mat$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}rn kernels, this is seen to be significantly larger than a fundamental {\$}\backslashOmega(T{\^{}}{\{}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}1+\backslashalpha{\}}{\}}){\$} lower bound on regret. We resolve this gap by developing novel Bayesian optimization algorithms, based on kernel approximation techniques, with regret bounds matching the lower bound in order for the SE kernel. We numerically benchmark the algorithms on environments based on both synthetic models and real-world data sets.},

  abstract      = {The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in many practical settings: predict the unknown parameters of an optimization problem, and then solve the problem using the predicted values of the parameters. A natural loss function in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions induced by the predicted parameters, in contrast to the prediction error of the parameters. This loss function was recently introduced in Elmachtoub and Grigas (2017), which called it the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss. Since the SPO loss is nonconvex and noncontinuous, standard results for deriving generalization bounds do not apply. In this work, we provide an assortment of generalization bounds for the SPO loss function. In particular, we derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of a polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of extreme points, but, in the case of a general convex set, have poor dependence on the dimension. By exploiting the structure of the SPO loss function and an additional strong convexity assumption on the feasible region, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the dimension via an analysis and corresponding bounds that are akin to the margin guarantees in classification problems.},

abstract = {In a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) it is essential to guarantee convergence of particles to a point in the search space (this property is called stability of particles). It is also important that the PSO algorithm converges to a local optimum (this is called the local convergence property). Further, it is usually expected that the performance of the PSO algorithm is not affected by rotating the search space (this property is called the rotation sensitivity). In this paper, these three properties, i.e. stability of particles, local convergence, and rotation sensitivity are investigated for a variant of PSO called Standard PSO2011 (SPSO2011). We experimentally define boundaries for the parameters of this algorithm in such a way that if the parameters are selected in these boundaries, the particles are stable, i.e. particles converge to a point in the search space. Also, we show that, unlike earlier versions of PSO, these boundaries are dependent on the number of dimensions of the problem. Moreover, we show that the algorithm is not locally convergent in general case. Finally, we provide a proof and experimental evidence that the algorithm is rotation invariant. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {Biocomposites has gained increasing attention in recent years. The environmental impacts of end-of-life (EoL) treatments of those emerging materials should be evaluated before they are produced and installed commercially, to ensure a minimal impact of these products all along their life cycle. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate environmental impacts of the EoL treatments of wood flour (WF) reinforced polypropylene (PP/WF) and flax fibers reinforced polylactic acid (PLA/Fl). The aim was to evaluate which EoL was the most environmental friendly to manage those emerging wastes in France and to help stakeholders of the waste sectors in their decisions. The attributional LCA was realized using the methodological framework of the international standard ISO 14040:2006. The study only focuses on the EoL of the biocomposites with four scenarios: incineration, landfill, composting and recycling. Mid-point indicators were evaluated thanks to the Recipe method. Results were also normalized to the annual mean environmental impact of a European inhabitant. For both biocomposites, recycling EoL scenario presents the lowest environmental impacts except for the freshwater eutrophication impact of the PP/WF EoL. Models should be completed in the future when new data will be available. Results obtained for both biocomposites are in agreement with the European waste hierarchy. If recycling of plastic is difficult to implement, incineration would be the preferable option for the PP/WF composite, while composting would be the other choice for PLA/Fl material.},

We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I{\&}D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.},

abstract = {Nowadays, performing multi-objective optimizations of actual building designs is one of the most challenging problems of the building energy efficiency area. This paper aims to propose an efficient method to solve multi-objective optimization building performance problems using a novel metamodel-based approach. To this end, the multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is dynamically coupled with artificial neural network (ANN) metamodels, which were previously trained with results of building performance simulations conducted using the EnergyPlusTM software. This new approach proposes an optimal way to generate the samples used to train and validate the ANN-based metamodels minimizing the total of building energy simulations necessary to train them, and guarantees accurate optimization results. To validate the strengths of the proposed method, it is applied to optimize the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of an actual dwelling in order to get the best trade-off (Pareto front) of the building between heating and cooling performance. This case study involves 12 of the more influential discrete and categorical design variables like roof types, external and internal wall types, solar orientation, solar absorptance, size and type of windows, and the dimension of external window shadings of this house among others, making a complex building performance optimization problem with more than 108 possibilities to choose. Furthermore, the results obtained are systematically compared and validated with the “true” Pareto front achieved using a simulate-based scheme which directly couples EnergyPlus program and NSGA-II algorithm. Results indicated that the presented method is able to reduce up to 75{\%} the number of building energy simulations needed to find the Pareto front of an actual multi-objective building performance optimization problem, keeping a good accuracy of the results.},

abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a successful methodology to optimize black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. While traditional methods optimize each black-box function in isolation, there has been recent interest in speeding up BO by transferring knowledge across multiple related black-box functions. In this work, we introduce a method to automatically design the BO search space by relying on evaluations of previous black-box functions. We depart from the common practice of defining a set of arbitrary search ranges a priori by considering search space geometries that are learned from historical data. This simple, yet effective strategy can be used to endow many existing BO methods with transfer learning properties. Despite its simplicity, we show that our approach considerably boosts BO by reducing the size of the search space, thus accelerating the optimization of a variety of black-box optimization problems. In particular, the proposed approach combined with random search results in a parameter-free, easy-to-implement, robust hyperparameter optimization strategy. We hope it will constitute a natural baseline for further research attempting to warm-start BO.},

The main contribution of this work is to exhibit a strong connection between achieving robustness to adversarial examples, and a rich class of polynomial optimization problems, thereby making progress on the above questions. In particular, we leverage this connection to (a) design computationally efficient robust algorithms with provable guarantees for a large class of hypothesis, namely linear classifiers and degree-2 polynomial threshold functions (PTFs), (b) give a precise characterization of the price of achieving robustness in a computationally efficient manner for these classes, (c) design efficient algorithms to certify robustness and generate adversarial attacks in a principled manner for 2-layer neural networks.

@article{Zuccarello2017,
abstract = {The present work deals with the experimental study of high performance biocomposites reinforced with optimized agave fibers, as well as the successive implementation of reliable micromechanical models that can be used at the design stage. In detail, systematical experimental analyses performed on biocomposites with epoxy or PLA matrix, have permitted to highlight that for short fibers biocomposites the reinforcing leads to a significant improvement of the matrix stiffness, whereas the particular damage mechanism based essentially on the matrix failure with consequent tensile failure of the fibers aligned with the applied load, does not allow to obtain an actual reinforcing of the matrix. Such a result is strictly related to the limited fiber stiffness, that lead to a low reinforcing of the matrixes. Consequently, as confirmed by the experimental evidence, the mechanical performance of such biocomposites is not affected significantly by the improvement of the matrix-fiber adhesion provided by the mercerization. Also, the best results are obtained by using the stiffer agave marginata fibers, extracted by simple mechanical pressing of the leafs, without any successive treatment. For long fiber biocomposites, instead, the experimental analysis has shown that for a given fiber treatment, the use of the more deformable PLA allows a better exploiting of the fiber properties, i.e. it leads always to more eco-friendly biocomposites with higher mechanical strength. Moreover, the use of the agave marginata permits to obtain biocomposites with strength higher than the biocomposites reinforced with the common agave sisalana (sisal), with improvements until to about 50{\%}; also, the use of fibers extracted by simple leafs pressing, allows the user to obtain high performance renewable biocomposites, characterized by high stiffness and strength comparable with that obtained by using mercerized fibers. Finally, the detailed analysis of the damage mechanisms, performed also by proper 2D and 3D micrographs, has permitted to implement accurate theoretical models that allows the user accurate predictions of the mechanical performance of biocomposites reinforced with short fibers or long fibers.},

abstract = {Hyperparameters are crucial to many machine learning algorithms. Conventional methods like grid search can be expensive when tuning hyperparameters of a complex model, for example, deep neural networks. Recently, Bayesian optimization has become popular in the machine learning community as an efficient tool for tuning hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a global optimization technique that is well suited for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Traditionally Bayesian optimization operates sequentially with one recommendation per trial. However, often a batch of recommendations can be simultaneously evaluated. Current batch Bayesian methods are mostly heuristic based and none have considered heteroscedastic nature of the unknown objective functions. This paper proposes a new batch Bayesian optimization method using a multi-scale search strategy. A batch of recommendations is constructed by searching for optimal recommendations across objective functions using alternate smoothness assumptions. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed batch improves the regret bound of the sequential method by an order of K, where K is the batch size. We show the effectiveness of our techniques by minimizing three benchmark global optimization test functions and tuning the hyperparameters of two machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

A drop-weight impact machine was instrumented with a high speed camera to measure the propagation of macro-cracks and correlate it to the force-displacement dynamic response at several impact energy levels. PP-hemp composites exhibit higher absorbed energies (up to 40{\%}) than PP-glass composites due to higher strain at break. The video tracking analysis highlights that for a given cumulated crack length, PP-hemp composite absorbs much more energy, related to differences in failure mechanisms.

abstract = {One of the fundamental difficulties in engineering design is the multiplicity of local solutions. This has triggered much effort in the development of global search algorithms. Globality, however, often has a prohibitively high numerical cost for real problems. A fixed cost local search, which sequentially becomes global, is developed in this work. Globalization is achieved by probabilistic restarts. A spacial probability of starting a local search is built based on past searches. An improved Nelder-Mead algorithm is the local optimizer. It accounts for variable bounds and nonlinear inequality constraints. It is additionally made more robust by reinitializing degenerated simplexes. The resulting method, called the Globalized Bounded Nelder-Mead (GBNM) algorithm, is particularly adapted to tackling multimodal, discontinuous, constrained optimization problems, for which it is uncertain that a global optimization can be afforded. Numerical experiments are given on two analytical test functions and two composite laminate design problems. The GBNM method compares favorably with an evolutionary algorithm, both in terms of numerical cost and accuracy.},

In absence of knowledge of the noise-statistics, discriminating better trial solutions from the rest becomes difficult in the “selection” step of an evolutionary optimization algorithm with noisy objective/s. This paper provides a thorough survey of the present state-of-the-art research on noisy evolutionary algorithms for both single and multi-objective optimization problems. This is undertaken by incorporating one or more of the five strategies in traditional evolutionary algorithms. The strategies include (i) fitness sampling of individual trial solution, (ii) fitness estimation of noisy samples, (iii) dynamic population sizing over the generations, (iv) adaptation of the evolutionary search strategy, and (v) modification in the selection strategy.},

  abstract  = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GP have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

A special steel-cast metal mold was used to fabricate the composites. The ESPs were loaded into the epoxy with amounts of 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.{\%}. An amine-based curing agent was used for the curing process. The samples were characterized for the mechanical (tensile, flexural and impact), thermal (TGA and DSC), structural (FTIR and XRD) and morphological (SEM) properties. Result analyses showed that 15 wt.{\%} of ESPs was the optimum loading for the better properties of the composites. Therefore, the properties of the ESPs-based epoxy composite were compared with the inorganic CaCO3 -based composite at a similar amount of filler loading (15 wt.{\%}). Results showed that the addition of fillers decreased the tensile strength of the composites than neat epoxy, whereas tensile modulus was increased. The flexural strength of the composite was increased at the loading of 15 wt.{\%} of ESPs, but it was decreased for the composite prepared with CaCO3 at the same amount. Overall, the ESPs showed better properties than CaCO3, and they can be used as an ecological, environmentally friendly and low-cost alternative of some inorganic fillers.},

This paper reviews the canonical models of these communities, and proposes a universal modeling framework that encompasses all of these competing approaches. At the heart is an objective function that optimizes over policies that is standard in some approaches, but foreign to others. We then identify four meta-classes of policies that encompasses all of the approaches that we have identified in the research literature or industry practice. In the process, we observe that any adaptive learning algorithm, whether it is derivative-based or derivative-free, is a form of policy that can be tuned to optimize either the cumulative reward (similar to multi-armed bandit problems) or final reward (as is used in ranking and selection or stochastic search). We argue that the principles of bandit problems, long a niche community, should become a core dimension of mainstream stochastic optimization.},

Increasing congestion situations constantly require urbanists to enhance traffic fluidity, while limiting pollutant emissions and vehicle consumption to improve inhabitants' welfare. Various mono or multi-objective optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy logic algorithms or even particle swarm optimizations, help to reach optimal traffic signal settings. However, those methods are usually designed to tackle very specific transportation configurations. Here, we introduce an extended version of the SIALAC benchmark, bringing together several real-world-like study cases with various features related to population, working activities, or traffic light devices. We drive a fitness landscape analysis on these various benchmark instances, which helps to improve the design of optimization algorithms for this class of real-world mobility problems. Thereby, we propose a new adaptive optimization algorithm to tackle each scenario of the benchmark.},

abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes bruteforce search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

The effect of two different treatments, alkali bleaching (CSS{\_}A) and esterification with palmitoyl chloride (CSS{\_}P), on mechanical, thermal, morphological and water absorption behavior of produced materials at different CSS loading (10, 20 and 30 wt {\%}) was investigated. A reactive graft copolymerization of BioPE with maleic anhydride was considered in the case of alkali treated CSS. It was found that, when introduced in bulk samples, improvement in the elastic modulus and a reduction in strain at maximum stress were observed with the increase in CSS fraction for the untreated and treated CSS composites, while the low aspect ratio of the CSS particles and their poor adhesion with the polymeric matrix were responsible for reduced ductility in films, decreasing crystallinity values and reduction of elastic moduli. When CSS{\_}A and CSS{\_}P are introduced in the matrix, a substantial reduction in the water uptake is also obtained in films, mainly due to presence of maleated PE, that builds up some interactions to eliminate the amounts of OH groups and hydrophobized CSS, due to the weakened absorption capacity of the functionalized CSS.},

abstract = {Wind farm layout optimisation is a challenging real-world problem which requires the discovery of trade-off solutions considering a variety of conflicting criteria, such as minimisation of the land area usage and maximisation of energy production. However, due to the complexity of handling multiple objectives simultaneously, many approaches proposed in the literature often focus on the optimisation of a single objective when deciding the locations for a set of wind turbines spread across a given region. In this study, we tackle a multi-objective wind farm layout optimisation problem. Different from the previously proposed approaches, we are applying a high-level search method, known as selection hyper-heuristic to solve this problem. Selection hyper-heuristics mix and control a predefined set of low-level (meta)heuristics which operate on solutions. We test nine different selection hyper-heuristics including an online learning hyper-heuristic on a multi-objective wind farm layout optimisation problem. Our hyper-heuristic approaches manage three well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms as low-level metaheuristics. The empirical results indicate the success and potential of selection hyper-heuristics for solving this computationally difficult problem. We additionally explore other objectives in wind farm layout optimisation problems to gain a better understanding of the conflicting nature of those objectives.},

Various natural fibers have emerged as potential replacements to synthetic fibers as reinforcing materials composites owing to their fairly better mechanical properties, low cost, environment friendliness and biodegradability. Selection of appropriate constituents of composites for a particular application is a tedious task for a designer/engineer. Impact loading has emerged as the serious threat for the composites used in structural or secondary structural application and demands the usage of appropriate fiber and matrix combination to enhance the energy absorption and mitigate the failure. The objective of the present review is to explore the composite with various fiber and matrix combination used for impact applications, identify the gap in the literature and suggest the potential naturally available fiber and matrix combination of composites for future work in the field of impact loading. The novelty of the present study lies in exploring the combination of naturally available fiber and matrix combination which can help in better energy absorption and mitigate the failure when subjected to impact loading. In addition, the application of multi attributes decision making (MADM) tools is demonstrated for selection of fiber and matrix materials which can serve as a benchmark study for the researchers in future.},

abstract = {A selection hyper-heuristic is used to minimise the objective functions of a well-known set of benchmark problems. The resulting sequences of low level heuristic selections and objective function values are used to generate a database of heuristic selections. The sequences in the database are broken down into subsequences and the mathematical concept of a logarithmic return is used to discriminate between “effective” subsequences, which tend to decrease the objective value, and “disruptive” subsequences, which tend to increase the objective value. These subsequences are then employed in a sequenced based hyper-heuristic and evaluated on an unseen set of benchmark problems. Empirical results demonstrate that the “effective” subsequences perform significantly better than the “disruptive” subsequences across a number of problem domains with 99{\%} confidence. The identification of subsequences of heuristic selections that can be shown to be effective across a number of problems or problem domains could have important implications for the design of future sequence based hyper-heuristics.},

  abstract   = {In this work we benchmark, for the first time, the latest Standard Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm (SPSO-2011) against the 28 test functions designed for the Special Session on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimisation at CEC-2013. SPSO-2011 is a major improvement over previous PSO versions, with an adaptive random topology and rotational invariance constituting the main advancements. Results showed an outstanding performance of SPSO-2011 for the family of unimodal and separable test functions, with a fast convergence to the global optimum, while good performance was observed for four rotated multimodal functions. Conversely, SPSO-2011 showed the weakest performance for all composition problems (i.e. highly complex functions specially designed for this competition) and certain multimodal test functions. In general, a fast convergence towards the region of the global optimum was achieved, requiring less than 10E+03 function evaluations. However, for most composition and multimodal functions SPSO2011 showed a limited capability to “escape” from sub-optimal regions. Despite this limitation, a desirable feature of SPSO-2011 was its scalable behaviour, which observed up to 50-dimensional problems, i.e. keeping a similar performance across dimensions with no need for increasing the population size. Therefore, it seems advisable that future PSO improvements be focused on enhancing the algorithm's ability to solve non-separable and asymmetrical functions, with a large number of local minima and a second global minimum located far from the true optimum. This work is the first effort towards providing a baseline for a fair comparison of future PSO improvements.},

  abstract  = {Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation. Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) Most natural optimization problems, including those arising in important application areas, are NP-hard. Therefore, under the widely believed con jecture that P -=/= NP, their exact solution is prohibitively time consuming. Charting the landscape of approximability of these problems, via polynomial time algorithms, therefore becomes a compelling subject of scientific inquiry in computer science and mathematics. This book presents the theory of ap proximation algorithms as it stands today. It is reasonable to expect the picture to change with time. This book is divided into three parts. In Part I we cover combinato rial algorithms for a number of important problems, using a wide variety of algorithm design techniques. The latter may give Part I a non-cohesive appearance. However, this is to be expected - nature is very rich, and we cannot expect a few tricks to help solve the diverse collection of NP-hard problems. Indeed, in this part, we have purposely refrained from tightly cat egorizing algorithmic techniques so as not to trivialize matters. Instead, we have attempted to capture, as accurately as possible, the individual character of each problem, and point out connections between problems and algorithms for solving them.},

This paper reviews the various self-healing technologies currently being developed for fibre reinforced polymeric composite materials, most of which are bioinspired, inspired by observation of nature. The most recent self-healing work has attempted to mimic natural healing through the study of mammalian blood clotting and the design of vascular networks found in biological systems. A perspective on current and future self-healing approaches using this biomimetic technique is offered. The intention is to stimulate debate outside the engineering community and reinforce the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in this exciting field.},

The flax was modified by drying, followed by plasticiser absorption to replace the water lost to prevent embrittlement. This protects the fibres from problems associated with their water content and changes in water content due to equilibration with the environment. Flax and PHB showed good interfacial adhesion, which was decreased when plasticisers were present. Some plasticiser migrated from the flax to PHB and caused complex changes in the glass transition, crystallisation and crystallinity of the PHB. Morphology of the composites was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy (OM), SEM provided information on the interfacial adhesion through fractography. OM showed extensive transcrystallinity along the fibre surfaces. Dynamic mechanical analysis was used to measure elastic and damping characteristics and their relation to composition and morphology.

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called Divide-and-Conquer), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new exercises and problems have been added for this edition. As of the third edition, this textbook is published exclusively by the MIT Press.},

A population of individuals, which encode the problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of the fittest through genetic operations, such as mutation, crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior (R.C. Eberhart et al., 1996; R.C. Eberhart and J. Kennedy, 1996; J. Kennedy and R.C. Eberhart, 1995; J. Kennedy, 1997). As in other algorithms, a population of individuals exists. This algorithm is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school of flying birds. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, these individuals are evolved by cooperation and competition among the individuals themselves through generations. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. We introduce a new parameter, called inertia weight, into the original particle swarm optimizer. Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective impact of this new parameter on the particle swarm optimizer.},

Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together – it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics.},

  abstract   = {Many optimization problems in various fields have been solved using diverse optimization al gorithms. Traditional optimization techniques such as linear programming (LP), non-linear programming (NLP), and dynamic program ming (DP) have had major roles in solving these problems. However, their drawbacks generate demand for other types of algorithms, such as heuristic optimization approaches (simulated annealing, tabu search, and evolutionary algo rithms). However, there are still some possibili ties of devising new heuristic algorithms based on analogies with natural or artificial phenom ena. A new heuristic algorithm, mimicking the improvisation of music players, has been devel oped and named Harmony Search (HS). The performance of the algorithm is illustrated with a traveling salesman problem (TSP), a specific academic optimization problem, and a least-cost pipe network design problem.},

  abstract  = {Biocomposites can be designed and engineered from plant bio-fibres and a blend of unsaturated polyester resin and derivatized vegetable oil to replace existing glass fibre-polyester composites for use in housing applications. Natural fibre composites (biocomposites) would provide environmental gains, reduced energy consumption, lighter weight, insulation and sound absorption properties, thus providing many beneficial additions to the American Advanced Housing program. Biocomposites were made using a non-woven fibre mat (90\% Hemp fibre with 10\% thermoplastic polyester binder) as reinforcement, and unsaturated polyester (UPE) resin as well as blends of UPE and functionalized vegetable oils as the polymer matrix. All composites were made with 30\% volume fraction of fibre, which was optimized earlier. The structure–property relationships of this system as well as the thermo-mechanical properties of these composites were measured. The notched Izod impact strength of biocomposites from bio-based resin blends of UPE and functionalized vegetable oil and industrial hemp fibre mat are enhanced by 90\% as compared to that of the pure UPE-industrial hemp fibre mat composites. The initial tests also show an improvement in the tensile properties of the composite as a result of the incorporation of the derivatized vegetable oil. The morphological changes of the matrix and composites have been analyzed using electron microscopy.},

  abstract  = {Three types of mineral fillers—talc, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and kaolin (10–40 wt \% filler loadings)—were compounded with polypropylene (PP) with a twin-screw extruder. The composites were injection-molded, and the effects of the filler loading on the mechanical, flow, and thermal properties for the three different types of filled composites were investigated. The aim was to compare their properties and to deduce prospective filler combinations that would yield hybrid PP composites in following studies. The results showed that in most cases, the strength and stiffness of the talc-filled PP composites was significantly higher than those of the CaCO3- and kaolin-filled PP composites. However, CaCO3, being a nonreactive filler, increased the toughness of PP. The kaolin-filled PP composites also showed some improvement in terms of strength and stiffness, although the increases in these properties were not as significant as those of the talc-filled PP composites. The effects of interfacial interactions between the fillers and PP on the mechanical properties were also evaluated with semiempirical equations. The nucleating ability of all three fillers was studied with differential scanning calorimetry, and the strongest nucleating agent of the three was talc, followed by CaCO3 and kaolin. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Interfacial interactions significantly influence the properties of particulate filled polymers. The adhesion between the particles and the polymer matrix depends on the size (area) of the interface and the strength of the interaction. While the former quantity is related to the specific surface area of the filler, the strength of the interaction can be modified by its surface treatment. In the current experiments polypropylene composites were prepared which contained different amounts of filler treated with eight functional trialkoxy silane coupling agents and the routinely used stearic acid, for comparison. Tensile properties of the composites were determined and the effect of interfacial interaction was evaluated by semi-empirical equations developed previously. Significant difference was detected in the effect of the various silane coupling agents. Amino functional silanes increase the strength of the interaction considerably. The other coupling agents reduce the surface tension of the filler, which leads to a decrease in the reversible work of adhesion between the filler and the polymer. These changes result in a decrease in the tensile strength of the composite. The results also prove the validity of the model equations applied. Parameter B, a measure of the strength of the interaction, was calculated for each silane coupling agent thus quantitatively characterizing their effectiveness.},

Composites with filler loading from 10 to 60wt\% were prepared by compression molding using untreated and ?-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MRPS)-modified ONF. The evolution of mechanical performance, dynamic mechanical properties, impact properties and water absorbance, were investigated as a function of the filler content. The changes in the mechanical properties as well as the water absorption behavior were shown to be greatly affected by the silane treatment of the filler. A better enhancement in the stiffening effect and a reduction in water absorption were noted when silane treated ONF was used. Evidence of the improvement of the interfacial adhesion following the silane modification was supported by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and SEM observation. These results were explained in terms of the improvement in the interfacial adhesion between the filler and the matrix through the aptitude of the MRPS to provide a chemical connectivity between the two phases.},

  abstract   = {Spain, Greece, Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey are the most important olive-oil producers in the Mediterranean basin representing about 95\% of the world production. The undeniable nutritional merits of olive-oil are well known, thus increasing the demand for it. However, if the undeniable nutritional merits of olive-oil are well known, the extraction process generates an amount of solid residue called “olive cake,” which is obtained after extracting the oil from the fruit. Currently, from 100kg of olives, about 20\% of oil is recovered, and 30\% of olive cake and about 50\% of aqueous liquor are generated. The use of the ground solid waste as a sustainable filler in polymer-based composite might constitute an interesting valorization within the field of material technology. In fact, given the high hardness of the olive stones, an enhancement in the stiffness of the polymer when the ground olive-stone residue is incorporated within a thermoplastic polymer matrix is achieved. This chapter summarizes the most recent advances of the use of olive solid residue ground in the form of flour (OSF) as a lignocellulosic filler for wide ranges of thermoplastic matrix, including polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and polyethylene, and analyzes the impact of the effect of the incorporation of the OSF on the tensile properties, flexural properties, impact strength, thermal properties, and abrasion resistance.},

  abstract  = {Natural abundance, much higher strength per unit weight than most inorganic fillers, lower density and their biodegradable nature make natural fillers attractive as reinforcements of engineering polymer systems. However, certain drawbacks such as incompatibility with the hydrophobic polymer matrix, the tendency to form aggregates during processing and poor resistance to moisture greatly reduce the potential of natural fibres to be used as reinforcements in polymers. In this review, the main results presented in literature are summarized, focusing on the processing behaviour and final properties of natural fibres with polymeric matrices (thermoplastics, thermosets and biodegradables) and paying attention to the use of physical and chemical treatments for the improvement of fibre-matrix interaction and composite mechanicaln properties. This work mainly focuses on the use of natural fibres for automotive applications.},

  abstract   = {Present review deals with the recent development of cellulosic/cellulosic and cellulosic/synthetic fibres based reinforced hybrid composites. Hybrid composites made up of two different cellulosic fibres are less common compare to cellulosic/synthetic fibre, but these are also potentially useful materials with respect to environmental concerns. Hybrid composites fabrication by cellulosic fibres is economical and provide another dimension to the versatility of cellulosic fibre reinforced composites. As a consequence, a balance in cost and performance could be achieved through proper material design as per directive of Europe states by 2015. Recent studies relevant to hybrid composites have cited in this review. This work intended to present an outline of main results presented on hybrid composites focusing the attention in terms of processing, mechanical, physical, electrical, thermal and dynamic mechanical properties. Hybrid composites are one of the emerging fields in polymer science that triumph attention for application in various sectors ranging from automobile to the building industry.},

  abstract  = {Natural rubber was reinforced with sisal and oil palm fibers and was subjected to dynamic mechanical analysis to determine the dynamic properties as a function of temperature. The storage modulus E' was found to increase with weight fraction of fiber. This is due to the increased stiffness imparted by the natural fibers. Loss modulus increased with loading while the damping property was found to decrease. The fibers were subjected to alkali treatment of different concentrations namely 0.5, 1, 2, and 4\% and the dynamic properties were studied. In the case of composites containing chemically modified fibers, storage modulus and loss modulus were found to increase. Scanning electron micrographs of tensile fracture surfaces of treated and untreated composites demonstrated better fiber–matrix bonding in the case of the former. POLYM.

The results of these treatments on fiber wetting and interfacial properties have already been reported in a previous article [Van de Velde, K. and Kiekens, P. (2001). J. Thermoplastic Com. Mat., 14: 244-245]. Further characterization of the treated fibers by sorption tests, roughness estimation, and tensile testing was done in order to provide additional information on the fiber properties. Based on these fiber and interface properties, a selection of fibers and matrices was made and some tests were done on the resulting composites. These composites consisted of MAA-PP treated flax fibers or untreated fibers as reinforcement, and MAA-PP or unmodified PP as matrix material. The tests on the composites included flexural, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and sorption tests, as well as determination of composite compositions. As could be expected from the earlier test results on the fibers and interface, the composites based on MAA-PP treated fibers, as well as those based on an MAA-PP matrix, generally had improved composite properties. The composites made with an MAA-PP matrix were not only the easiest ones to produce, they also had the best properties.},

Since data tend to be widely scattered over many sources, it is the purpose of this article to give an overview of the most relevant properties of a range of thermoplastic polymers. The reported properties are divided into mechanical, physical, and thermal ones. It is clear that many of these properties are interrelated. By consequence some combinations of desired properties are not possible but an overview such as this may provide a useful guide in establishing the best compromise between conflicting property demands. Data are presented mostly as ranges (in tables) as well as in graphs for quick comparison reasons. One specific application (thermoplastic pultrusion with flax as reinforcement) is also studied. In this particular case, polypropylene is found to have the best combination of properties in order to be used as the composite matrix.},

The composites used were made of flax and jute yarns and wovens as reinforcements for epoxy resins, polyester resins and polypropylene. Fibre type, textile architecture, interphase properties, fibre properties and content were found to affect the fatigue behaviour strongly as illustrated with damping versus applied maximum load curves. It was found that natural fibre reinforced plastics with higher fibre strength and modulus, stronger fibre–matrix adhesion or higher fibre fractions possess higher critical loads for damage initiation and higher failure loads. In addition, damage propagation rates were reduced. Furthermore, unidirectional composites were less sensitive to fatigue induced damage than woven reinforced ones.},

  abstract  = {The effects of different types of fibers on the physical and mechanical behavior of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) are reported. In particular, the flow behavior, mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and impact resistance) and morphology are examined. It has been found that all the fibers studied behave as effective reinforcing agents for the polypropylene matrix. In fact, a notable increase of the mechanical properties is observed in presence of the fibers, the aramid ones being the most effective. Moreover, dynamic-mechanical measurements provide a further confirmation of the reinforcement effect of the fibers, where a sensible increment of the storage modulus in presence of the fibers is obtained. The morphology of the composites is analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A good fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion is observed, in particular, for aramid and glass fiber-reinforced composites. As expected, a good adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface gives rise to a sensible increment of composites properties.},

The influences of both the fibre content and presence of coupling agent were focused. The water absorption capability and water diffusion rate were considered for a statistical factorial analysis. Afterwards, the physico-chemical properties of water-saturated biocomposites were assessed by Fourier-Transform Infrared Analysis, Size Exclusion Chromatography, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Scanning Electron Microscopy. It was found that the water diffusion rate increased with both temperature and percentage of fibre, whereas the amount of absorbed water was only influenced by fibre content. The use of coupling agent was only relevant at the initial stages of the hydrothermal test, giving an increase in the diffusion rate. Although the chemical structure and thermal properties of water-saturated biocomposites remained practically intact, the physical performance was considerably affected, due to the swelling of fibres, which internally blew-up the PHBV matrix, provoking cracks and fibre detachment.},

The mechanical properties of the different natural fibre composites were tested and compared. A further comparison was made with the corresponding properties of glass mat reinforced polypropylene composites from the open literature. Kenaf, hemp and sisal composites showed comparable tensile strength and modulus results but in impact properties hemp appears to out-perform kenaf. The tensile modulus, impact strength and the ultimate tensile stress of kenaf reinforced polypropylene composites were found to increase with increasing fibre weight fraction. Coir fibre composites displayed the lowest mechanical properties, but their impact strength was higher than that of jute and kenaf composites. In most cases the specific properties of the natural fibre composites were found to compare favourably with those of glass.},

  abstract   = {A study has been carried out to investigate the tensile, flexural and dielectric properties of composites made by reinforcing vakka as a new natural fibre into a polyester resin matrix. The fibres extracted by retting and manual processes have been used to fabricate the composites. These composites are tested for tensile, flexural and dielectric properties and compared with those of established composites like sisal, bamboo and banana made under the same laboratory conditions. The composites are fabricated up to a maximum volume fraction of fibre of 0.37 in the case of tensile testing, and 0.39 for flexural and dielectric testing. It has been observed that the tensile properties increase with respect to volume fraction of fibre for vakka fibre composite and are also more than those of sisal and banana composites and comparable to those of bamboo composites. The flexural strength of vakka fibre composite is more than that of banana composite and is closer to sisal fibre composite with respect to the volume fraction of fibre, where as the flexural modulus is much higher than those of banana and sisal fibre composites and also very much closer to bamboo fibre composites. The dielectric strength of vakka fibre composite increases with increase in volume fraction of fibre in the composite unlike the case of sisal, bamboo and banana composites. The dielectric strength being a unique feature of vakka fibre composite, can be suggested for electrical insulation applications.},

Composite materials replace the conventional materials because of their high specific strength, strong damping capacity and high specific modulus. In modern era, natural fiber reinforced polymer composites came into light because of promising properties of natural fibers such as light weight, water resistance, high impact strength, environment friendly etc. In this study, different types of natural fibers that can be used as reinforcement in polymer composite are discussed. Various methods of production and steps involved in processing of natural fiber reinforced composite are presented.

  abstract  = {The application of natural fibers as reinforcement in polymer composites has been continuously growing during the last few decades. These composites find diverse applications in hostile environment where they are exposed to external attacks such as solid particle erosion. Also, in many respects, the mechanical properties of different polymer composites are their most important characteristics. Therefore, improvement of the erosion resistance and mechanical behavior of polymer composites are the prime requirements in their applications. Bamboo fiber which is rich in cellulose, relatively inexpensive, and abundantly available has the potential for reinforcement in polymers. To this end, an attempt has been made in this paper not only to study the utilization potential of bamboo fiber in polymer composites but also to study the effect of various parameters on mechanical and erosion wear performance of bamboo fiber reinforced epoxy composites.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, the experiments of tensile and flexural tests were carried out on composites made by reinforcing jowar as a new natural fibre into polyester resin matrix. The samples were prepared up to a maximum volume fraction of approximately 0.40 from the fibres extracted by retting and manual process, and compared with established composites like sisal and bamboo developed under similar laboratory conditions. Jowar fibre has a tensile strength of 302MPa, modulus of 6.99GPa and an effective density of 922kg/m3. It was observed that the tensile strength of jowar fibre composite is almost equal to that of bamboo composite, 1.89 times to that of sisal composite and the tensile modulus is 11\% and 45\% greater than those of bamboo and sisal composites, respectively at 0.40 volume fraction of fibre. The flexural strength of jowar composite is 4\%, 35\% and the flexural modulus is 1.12 times, 2.16 times greater than those of bamboo and sisal composites, respectively. The results of this study indicate that using jowar fibres as reinforcement in polyester matrix could successfully develop a composite material in terms of high strength and rigidity for light weight applications compared to conventional sisal and bamboo composites.},

Adhesive wear performance of BMBFRE composite was found to be superior for AP-O. The frictional performance of BMBFRE composite was found to be greater at low sliding velocity for AP-O by 44\% relative to the high sliding velocity. The temperature differential of BMBFRE composite for AP-O to the sliding direction gave lower interface temperatures of about 31.4\% and 13.2\% as compared to R-O and P-O. The predominant wear mechanisms for AP-O was back film transfer associated with the formation of fine grooves on the worn surfaces.},

  abstract  = {A new method is presented for the development of natural fiber composites of high-performance thermoplastic polymers considering poly(phenylene ether) (PPE) and wood flour as an example system. The large gap between the high processing temperature of PPE, typically between 280 and 320°C, and the low decomposition temperature of wood flour, about 200°C, was reduced by using a reactive solvent, a low molecular weight epoxy. The epoxy formed miscible blends with PPE, which offered much lower viscosity compared to PPE and processing temperatures well below the decomposition temperature of wood flour. In addition, the epoxy component accumulated around the polar wood flour particles upon polymerization during the fabrication step. The composite materials consisted of a thermoplastic continuous phase and two dispersed phases, one of polymerized epoxy and the other of wood flour particles coated with polymerized epoxy. These composites offered a significant reduction in density and better mechanical and physical properties when compared to commercially available grades of engineering polymer blends filled with short glass fibers. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This research will focus on Kenaf; an extremely valuable natural fiber with robust mechanical properties. In this research, kenaf fiber/fiberglass reinforced with unsaturated polyester composites were subjected to water absorption test. Water absorption test were conducted by immersing specimens into three different environmental conditions including sea water, distilled water and rain water (acidic solutions) at room temperature from 1st day until 4th week. The effect of the mechanical strength of the hybrid composties is investigated. In general, the mechanical properties of kenaf fiber are deteriorated after the moisture penetrates into the composite. The strain to failure increases from 1st day until 3rd week followed by a drastically drop at 4th week. The humidity aging is one of the evidence found in SEM micrograph which contributes to the reduction of tensile modulus.},

Kenaf fibres reinforced epoxy (KFRE) composite was fabricated using a closed mould technique associated with vacuum system. Sliding wear and frictional behaviour of the composite were studied against polished stainless steel counterface using Block-On-Disc (BOD) machine at different applied loads (30–100N), sliding distances (0–5km) and sliding velocities (1.1–3.9m/s). The effect of the fibre orientations, with respect to the sliding direction, was considered; these orientations are parallel (P-O), anti-parallel (AP-O) and normal (N-O). The morphology of the worn surfaces of the composite was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The result revealed that the presence of kenaf fibres in the composite enhanced the wear and frictional performance of the epoxy. Applied load and sliding velocity have less effect on the specific wear rate of the composite in all the three orientations. The composite exhibited better wear performance in N-O compared to P-O and AP-O.},

  abstract = {The thermal degradation behaviour of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) fibres under a nitrogen atmosphere was investigated by using thermogravimetry (TGA). The kinetic activation energy of treated fibres was calculated from TGA data by using a varied heating rate from 2.5 to 30°C/min. The greater activation energy of treated hemp fibre compared with untreated fibre represented an increase of purity and improvement in structural order. A hydrophobic solvent affected the degree of non-cellulosic removal. Mercerisation and enzyme scouring removed non-cellulosic components from the fibre; however, structural disruption was observed after higher alkaline concentration, 20\%wt/v and longer scouring time, respectively. Structural disruption was observed by X-ray measurement. The FTIR results indicated an elimination of the non-cellulosic components by the mercerisation treatment and a specific removal of low methoxy pectin by use of pectate lyase enzyme (EC 4.2.2.2). An increase of temperature at the maximum rate of degradation and the rate of weight loss was characteristic of the purity and structure of treated hemp fibre.},

The composites were tested in tension, short-beam interlaminar shear stress and in impact. There was an increase in the tensile strength and modulus for resins with high-hydroxyl-group based composites. Similar results were obtained for interlaminar shear stress while low-hydroxyl group euphorbia resin based composites exhibited high impact strength. The euphorbia resin with high hydroxyl content yielded composites with high stiffness. The use of euphorbia-based resins in composite manufacture increases the value of the euphorbia oil as well as creating a new route of composite manufacturing.},

  abstract  = {Biocomposites were produced using polycaprolactone (PCL) and starch as the matrix, and washed and treated sisal fibres as reinforcement. The matrix consists of a biodegradable product commercially known as MaterBi-Z®, which is based on a PCL, starch and additive., Alkaline and acetylation treatments were performed on the fibre in order to enhance the adhesion degree and the compatibility between the fibre and the matrix. The effect of chemical treatment on morphology, physical and chemical properties and tensile properties of fibres and composites were determined. Tensile properties of the biodegradable composite were improved by the presence of the fibre. However, the untreated fibres behaved as better reinforcement than the acetylated and alkalitreated fibres. This was attributed to an impairment of the mechanical properties of the acetylated fibres and incompatibility of the alkali-treated fibres. The results observed are supported by SEM analysis of fibres and the composite materials.},

Addition of relatively small amount of glass fibre to the pineapple leaf fibre and sisal fibre-reinforced polyester matrix enhanced the mechanical properties of the resulting hybrid composites. Different chemically modified sisal fibres have been used in addition to glass fibers as reinforcements in polyester matrix to enhance the mechanical properties of the resulting hybrid composites. The surface modification of sisal fibres such as alkali treatment produced optimum tensile and impact strengths, while cyanoethylation resulted in the maximum increase in flexural strength of the hybrid composites. It has been observed that water uptakes of hybrid composites are less than that of unhybridized composites. Scanning electron microscopic studies have been carried out to study the fibre-matrix adhesion.},

The influence of the acetylation on the structure and properties of flax fibre were investigated as well as modified flax fibre reinforced polypropylene composites were also prepared. The catalyst was used to accelerate acetylation reaction rate. Flax fibre was characterised after modification. Surface morphology, moisture absorption property, components content, degree of polymerisation, crystallinity of cellulose and thermal stability of flax fibres were studied. Due to acetylation, the flax fibre surface morphology and moisture resistance properties improved remarkably. Flax fibre (modified and unmodified) reinforced polypropylene composites were fabricated with 30 wt\% fibre loading. The mechanical properties were investigated for those composites. Tensile and flexural strengths of composites were found to increase with increasing degree of acetylation up to 18\% and then decreased. Charpy impact strengths of composites were found to decrease with increasing degree of acetylation. Owing to addition of coupling agent (maleated polypropylene -MAH), the tensile and flexural strength properties were found to increase in between 20 to 35\% depending on degree of acetylation},

In order to improve fiber/matrix interfacial properties, fibers were subjected to chemical treatments, namely, mercerization, silane treatment, benzoylation, and peroxide treatment. Selective removal of non-cellulosic compounds constitutes the main objective of the chemical treatments of flax fibers to improve the performance of fiber-reinforced composites. Flax fibers were derived from Saskatchewan-grown flax straws. Composites consisting of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or HDPE/LLDPE mix, chemically treated fibers and additives were prepared by the extrusion process. The test samples were prepared by rotational molding. The fiber surface morphology and the tensile fracture surfaces of the composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of the different chemical treatments on the mechanical and the physical properties of natural fiber-reinforced composites were investigated. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the melting point of the fiber-reinforced composites.},

  abstract = {Natural fiber reinforced polymer composites have many applications because of their ease of fabrication, relatively low cost, low density and renewable resource. In spite of the various desirable properties of natural fiber to act as a reinforcing material, poor adhesion characteristics between natural fiber and polymer resin result in low mechanical properties. In this study, jute–thermoset composites were fabricated by using unsaturated polyester and epoxy resins. To improve the adhesion between jute fabric and thermoset, alkali treated jute fibers were treated with oligomeric siloxane. FTIR analysis was used to confirm the surface treatment. The effects of fiber surface treatment on the mechanical properties of jute reinforced thermoset composites were determined by using tensile test, flexure test and short beam shear test. The fractured surfaces of composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) technique. Once jute fabrics were treated 1\% siloxane concentration, the tensile and flexure properties of silane treated jute thermoset composites increased. Surface treatment of jute fiber caused a significant increase in the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the thermoset composites. From SEM observations, better adhesion was observed for the jute/thermoset composites in the presence of oligomeric siloxane.},

To improve the adhesion between jute fabric and polyester alkali-treated jute fabrics were treated with ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (?-MPS). The effect of silane concentrations (0.1\%, 0.3\%, and 0.5\%) on tensile properties, flexural properties, and interlaminar shear strength was investigated. Once jute fabrics were treated with 0.1\% and 0.3\% silane concentrations, the tensile properties of silane-treated jute polyester composites increased. However, when 0.5\% ?-MPS was used in silane treatment, the tensile properties of jute/polyester composites decreased. 0.3\% silane-treated jute/polyester composites exhibited superior improvements in terms of the flexure properties among the fabricated composites. Interlaminar shear strength measurements showed that best adhesion was provided by using 0.3\% silane-treated jute/polyester composites. Good adhesion between silane-treated jute fabric and polyester was also confirmed by scanning electron microscope observations.},

Flexural properties of maleic anhydride treated bamboo polyester composites improved by nearly 50\%. The tensile strength and modulus of permanganate-treated bamboo polyester composite increased by 58\% and 118\%. The tensile strength and modulus of benzoylated bamboo fiber polyester composite improved by 71\% and 118\%, respectively. After benzoylation of the bamboo fiber, the water absorption is 16\% for the bamboo-epoxy composite compared to 41\% by untreated bamboo-epoxy composite. The water absorption by benzylated bamboo reinforced polyester composite was 16.8\% compared to 51\% by untreated bamboo-polyester composite. Pre-impregnation improved the mechanical and water resistant properties of both epoxy and polyester-based composites. SEM investigations of the tensile fracture surfaces show that modifications improved the fiber—matrix interaction.},

  abstract   = {Long and random hemp and kenaf fibres were used in the as-received condition and alkalized with a 0.06 M NaOH solution. They were combined with polyester resin and hot-pressed to form natural fibre composites. The mechanical properties of the composites were measured to observe the effect of fibre alignment and alkalization. A general trend was observed whereby alkalized and long fibre composites gave higher flexural modulus and flexural strength compared with composites made from as-received fibres. Alkalized long kenaf–polyester composites possessed superior mechanical properties to alkalized long hemp–polyester composites. For the hemp–polyester composites a high flexural modulus and a high flexural strength are associated with a low work of fracture. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of the treated hemp and kenaf fibres showed the absence of surface impurities which were present on the untreated fibres. Apparent density measurements on hemp and kenaf fibres did not show a significant change after alkalization with 0.06 M NaOH. Wide endothermic peaks present in differential thermal analysis thermograms for all of the composites indicated the presence of moisture which leads to inferior mechanical properties. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis carried out on the polyester matrix composites showed that the alkalized fibre composites have higher E' values corresponding to higher flexural moduli. Any correlation between fibre surface treatment and the work of fracture and tand of composites is less clear.},

The filler was treated with sodium hydroxide at different immersion times and with vinil-tris-(2-metoxietoxi)-silane. Polypropylenes functionalized with maleic anhydride (maleated polypropylene, MAPP) were also used as compatibilizers. All the treatments showed the same tendency to slightly increase tensile modulus and tensile strength of the composites, but they did not affect their MFI. Morphological studies showed that the MAPP and silane improve the polymer–WF adhesion and the dispersion of the particles, while the alkaline treatment only improves the dispersion. The silane-modified samples and the use of MAPP produced samples with lower water absorption than those of untreated WF composites. The addition of the filler and the treatments carried out on it caused an increase in the crystallization temperature.},

Unnotched and notched impact strength of PVC/wood flour/glass fiber hybrid composites could be increased significantly without losing flexural properties by adding type L glass fibers and over 40\% of PVC. There was no such improvement when using type S glass fiber. The impact strength of hybrid composites increased along with the increment of the type L glass fiber content at a 50\% PVC content. At high PVC contents, impact fracture surfaces were characterized by wood particle, glass fiber breakage and pullout, whereas interfacial debonding was the dominant fracture mode at higher filler concentrations. The significant improvement in impact strength of hybrid composites was attributed to the formation of the three-dimensional network glass fiber architecture between type L glass fibers and wood flour.},

In this work the water absorption behavior of sisal/cotton, jute/cotton and ramie/cotton hybrid fabric reinforced composites is evaluated. The effect of the temperature of immersion, fiber volume fraction, and predrying of the fabrics before their incorporation onto the composites are evaluated. Sisal was shown to be the most hygroscopic of the fibers analyzed, and its presence leads to higher values of the maximum water content and of the diffusion coefficient of sisal/cotton reinforced composites. Under the range of temperatures analyzed (30–60°C) the volume fraction of the fibers, rather than the temperature itself, was shown to be the main parameter governing water absorption. Predrying usually lowers maximum water content, although for sisal/cotton reinforced composites a reverse trend was observed for the composites with higher volume fractions. This behavior was again attributed to the higher hydrophilic behavior of sisal fibers.},

It is shown that hybridization originated a material with general intermediate properties between pure glass and pure sisal. However, the importance of controlling the stacking sequence to enhance properties was evident. For instance, to optimize flexural behavior, there must be glass fibers mainly on the top and bottom surfaces. Furthermore, depending on the type of loading and stacking sequence, some hybrid composites may show properties very close to those of pure glass.},

Better performance was shown by composites having volume fraction, 0.40 Vf. Tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, and flexural modulus showed a positive hybrid effect when the volume ratio of the fiber was varied in the hybrid composites at each fiber loading. Maximum tensile strength was observed in composites having volume ratio of banana and sisal 3:1. When the volume ratio of sisal was increased, the impact strength of the composite increased. Different layering patterns were tried at 0.40 Vf, keeping the volume ratio of fibers 1:1. Tensile properties were slightly greater in the trilayer composite with banana as the skin material. Bilayer composites showed higher flexural and impact property. SEM studies were carried out to evaluate fiber/matrix interactions. Experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions.},

  abstract  = {The effects of weight fraction and length of short bamboo and glass fibers on flexural strength and inter-laminar shear strength (ILSS) of vinyl ester resin and unsaturated polyester (USP) resins were investigated. The bamboo fibers were isolated from the bamboo plant by treating them with dilute solution of sodium hydroxide (0.1 and 1 N NaOH) for 72 h and then boiling them in a pressure cooker for 30 min. The fibers were separated, dried, and cut into 5 or 10 mm lengths. Composites were fabricated using vinyl ester resin or USP resin as binders. The flexural properties of glass/bamboo fiber reinforced vinyl ester resins were higher than those based on USP resins. This may be due to better wetting of the fibers by VE resins due to their low viscosity and possibility of hydrogen bond formation with hydroxyl group on bamboo fibers. Hybrid composites were fabricated using 50 wt\% of fibers. The wt\% of bamboo fibers in these hybrid composites was varied as 25, 50, and 75 wt\% of chopped glass fibers (5 mm). Replacement of 25 wt\% of glass fibers did not affect the flexural modulus and a marginal increase in ILSS was observed. However, replacement of 75\% glass fibers by bamboo fibers resulted in a significant decrease in flexural strength, modulus and ILSS.},

Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) has been used as a coupling agent to improve the interfacial interaction between the fibers and matrix. The mechanical properties of the hybrid composites were studied from tensile, flexural, and impact tests. Mechanical tests indicated an increase in tensile, flexural, and impact strength of the BGRP hybrid composites at a bamboo:glass fiber ratio of 15:15 ratio in the presence of 2 wt\% of MAPP. Nearly, 69, 86, and 83\% increase in tensile flexural and impact strength respectively has been observed as compared with virgin PP. The fiber matrix interfacial morphology of the tensile fractured specimens was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed less fiber pullout and comparatively less gaps between the fiber and the base matrix in the case of MAPP treated hybrid composites. The crystallization, melting behavior and thermal stability of the hybrid composites were investigated employing differential scanning electron microscopy (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed an increase in thermal stability of the matrix polymer with incorporation of bamboo and glass fibers, confirming the effect of hybridization and efficient fiber matrix interfacial adhesion. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed an increase in storage modulus (E') indicating higher stiffness in case of hybrid composites as compared with untreated composites and virgin matrix. The tan d spectra presented a strong influence of fiber content and coupling agent on the a and ? relaxation process of PP.},

Green composites are a specific class of biocomposites, where a bio-based polymer matrix is reinforced by natural fibers, and they represent an emerging area in polymer science. This work discusses the environmental benefits deriving from the use of natural fibers in polymer composites and from substitution of oil-derived polymers by bio-based polymers as matrix material. New trends in the selection of natural fibers, that is, from waste rather than from valuable crops are described.

  abstract = {This paper is a review on the tensile properties of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites. Natural fibers have recently become attractive to researchers, engineers and scientists as an alternative reinforcement for fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Due to their low cost, fairly good mechanical properties, high specific strength, non-abrasive, eco-friendly and bio-degradability characteristics, they are exploited as a replacement for the conventional fiber, such as glass, aramid and carbon. The tensile properties of natural fiber reinforce polymers (both thermoplastics and thermosets) are mainly influenced by the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fibers. Several chemical modifications are employed to improve the interfacial matrix–fiber bonding resulting in the enhancement of tensile properties of the composites. In general, the tensile strengths of the natural fiber reinforced polymer composites increase with fiber content, up to a maximum or optimum value, the value will then drop. However, the Young’s modulus of the natural fiber reinforced polymer composites increase with increasing fiber loading. Khoathane et al. [1] found that the tensile strength and Young’s modulus of composites reinforced with bleached hemp fibers increased incredibly with increasing fiber loading. Mathematical modelling was also mentioned. It was discovered that the rule of mixture (ROM) predicted and experimental tensile strength of different natural fibers reinforced HDPE composites were very close to each other.

  abstract  = {In recent years, the amount of research on natural fibres and natural-fibre-based products has increased substantially. The reason for this increase is due to a greater awareness of the environment and the ever depleting trend of petroleum supplies. Natural fibre composites and in general, natural fibres have a big role to play towards a sustainable environmentally friendly future. The automotive industry is taking big steps toward a more eco-friendly product chain by implementing natural fibres as a base for making various components, such as seat backs, door panels, spare tyre and boot linings. The world production of natural fibres is increasing since the product base is increasing. Each year, more synthetic fibres and high energy consuming products are being replaced by natural-fibre-based products. The reason for this trend is not only due to an increased environmental awareness but also because natural fibres have excellent properties, such as light weight, and they have relatively low costs. This study attempts to review the most commercially important natural fibres and their automotive application and also looks at the properties, chemical composition and cost of some natural fibres being used in industry.},

  abstract   = {Among the synthetic fibers, glass fibers (GF) are most widely used in thermoplastic short-fiber-reinforced polymers (SFRP), as they offer good strength and stiffness, impact resistance, chemical resistance, and thermal stability at a low price. Carbon fibers (CF) are applied instead of GF, when highest stiffness is required. Other types of synthetic fibers like aramid (AF), basalt (BF), polyacrylonitrile (PAN-F), polyethylene terephthalate (PET-F), or polypropylene fibers (PP-F) are rarely used in SFRP, although they offer some advantages compared with GF. The aim of this article is, to give an overview of various fiber types with regard to their mechanical properties, densities, and prices as well as the performance of their thermoplastic composites. The mechanical properties are presented as Ashby plots of tensile strength versus tensile modulus, both in absolute and specific (absolute value divided by density) values. This overview also focuses on modification of fiber/matrix interaction, as interfacial adhesion has a huge impact on composite performance.

  abstract  = {A novel mechanical extraction process was developed to obtain long bamboo fibers to be used as reinforcement in structural composites. A single-fiber tensile test at four different span lengths for fibers of the bamboo species Guadua angustifolia was performed. Strength values of 800 MPa and Young’s modulus of 43 GPa were obtained. Unidirectional bamboo fiber/epoxy composites (BFC) were produced with untreated and alkali-treated fibers to evaluate the effectiveness of the new reinforcing material. Flexural tests were performed with two fiber orientations (longitudinal and transverse). The longitudinal flexural strength is higher when untreated fibers are used while the treatment benefits the longitudinal flexural stiffness of the composite. Transverse strength increases at lower alkali concentrations, but the transverse three-point bending strength of untreated bamboo in epoxy is already quite high at around 33 MPa. The results illustrate that these bamboo fibers present a natural and renewable option to reinforce composites in several applications where glass fiber and traditional natural fibers are used nowadays.},

Maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and a CNT masterbatch (CESA) were applied as compatibilizers. Mechanical properties, crystallization behavior, dynamic mechanical performance as well as interfacial morphology were characterized. SW fiber was successfully incorporated in the PP matrix in terms of mechanical reinforcement. Accelerated crystallization process of PP matrix was observed. DMA results also indicated the favorable adhesion between SW fiber and PP matrix, which could be confirmed by SEM characterization. The effect and efficiency of MAPP and CESA as compatibilizers were evaluated. Moreover, potential flame retardancy of SW fibers for PP matrix was observed, and satisfying results warrant further investigations. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010},

  abstract  = {This article reports the mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of polypropylene (PP)-chicken eggshell (ES) composites. Mechanical properties like tensile strength, tensile modulus, izod impact strength, flexural modulus of PP composites with normal (unmodified) eggshell and chemically treated ES [modified ES (MES) with isophthalic acid] have been investigated. PP–calcium carbonate (CaCO3) composites, at the same filler loadings, were also prepared and used as reference. The results showed that PP composites with chemically MES had better mechanical properties compared to the unmodified ES and CaCO3 composites. An increase of about 3–18\% in tensile modulus, 4–44\% in izod impact strength and 1.5–26\% in flexural modulus at different filler loading was observed in MES composites as compared to unmodified ES composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of fractured tensile specimens confirmed better interfacial adhesion of MES with polymer matrix resulting into lower voids and plastic deformation resulting in improved mechanicals of the composites. TEM micrographs showed acicular needle shaped morphology for modified ES and have contributed to better dispersion which is the prime reason for enhancement of all the mechanical properties. At higher filler loading, the modulus of MES composite was found to be higher by 5\% as compared to commercial CaCO3 composites. POLYM.

  abstract = {Due to the ubiquity and single-use character of plastic products, their production represents a burden to the environment. Therefore, an increasing interest in biodegradable and bio-compostable materials has been observed in the recent years. Bio-based materials are becoming more and more popular, especially in applications where biodegradability provides an advantage for customers and environment. However, biodegradable materials are more expensive compared with durable plastic materials, so to reduce costs and in order to improve their mechanical properties, biocomposites are created by reinforcement with natural fibers: cellulose, hemp, jute, cotton, etc. This paper is focused on the investigation of the selected group of biocomposites based on poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) with the addition of 15 wt\% of various fillers (nanocellulose, walnut shell flour, eggshell flour, and tuff). Thus far, there is limited information concerning comparison of the different natural fillers introduced into the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) matrix. Here, the following mechanical properties were evaluated: the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, strain at break, flexural modulus, and flexural stress at 3.5\% strain. The tensile test was performed at various temperatures (-?24, +?23, and +?60 °C), followed by samples conditioning in water and compost. Thermal behavior of the biocomposites was studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The study showed that the value of the elasticity modulus of each composite was higher in comparison with neat poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), at each of the above temperatures. The factor responsible for the enhancement of the mechanical properties of composites (enhancement of the stiffness of the material) was the increase in crystalline phase content in composites. Interestingly, at -?24 °C, all of the analyzed composites exhibited over twofold increase in tensile strength which was accompanied by an almost 30\% increase in elastic modulus. This phenomenon likely resulted from an increase in tensile strength and an increase in internal stress at interfaces within the components of the composites during tests. It was also observed that both conditioning in water and degradation in the compost heap led to a considerable decrease in mechanical properties of the examined composites. The scanning electron microscopy analysis, carried out to assess the distribution of particles and the adhesion of fillers to the matrix, revealed that the size and the shape of the particles affected the mechanical properties of the composites.},

For utilization of waste shellfish shell resource, granule of shellfish shell (SS) was prepared from waste shellfish shell by removing cuticle, crushing, grinding and shearing emulsification and was introduced as a filler to reinforce polypropylene (PP). The mechanical behavior of PP/SS composite shows a higher yield strain, yield strength, tensile strength and elongation at break than traditional commercial calcium carbonate (CC) filled PP. Yield strength of PP/SS composite with 2\% SS is improved by 11.1\% due to the formation of ß-crystalline PP phase. Using waste SS for producing bio-filler for filling PP is an effective and prospective measure to deal with waste SS, which is valuable for industrial production and practical application as fillers for reinforcing polymers.},

The natural filler extracted by manual process was subjected to alkali treatment with the concentrations of 2, 5 and 7 w/v\%. The composites fabricated by varying the weight fractions of filler in the range of 5 to 15 wt\%. The effects of bio-filler content of the composites on tensile and thermal properties were evaluated by Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), universal testing machine, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The studies reveal that the tensile strength and tensile modulus increased with the increasing of bio-filler content. The highest mechanical properties of 7 \% alkali treated PSP loaded Epoxy composite were achieved at biofiller mass content of 15 wt.\%. The morphology of the composites shows better bonding between the filler and resin, thus leading to improvement of the mechanical properties. The TGA results revealed that the polymer composites showed thermal resistance on increasing NaOH concentration and filler content.},

  abstract  = {The natural resource materials have an exceptional potential as reinforcement in plastic composites, due to their low cost, good mechanical properties, and biodegradability. This chapter is related to the use of some natural resources (nutshells residues) and their effect on polymer composite with varying filler reinforcement content and type or improving the adhesion between polymer matrix and filler. In this study, the used natural resources as bio-filler were almond shells, coir shells, argan shells, apricot shells, wood powder, and the mixture of these fillers, reinforcing thermoplastic polymer at various filler content (5, 10, and 20 wt.\%), through extrusion and injection molding processes. The chemical and physical properties of the bio-filler and bio-filler/polymer composites were defined by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); and tensile, torsional, and rheological tests. Depending on the bio-filler type, there was evidence that some particular difference in the chemical exists and also physical property changes. An increase in the crystallinity of composites is explained by the nucleating agent role of the bio-filler. The thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of the composites were mostly enhanced with the addition of bio-fillers compared to the neat polymer matrix, and optimal properties were reached. Also, some optimal properties were observed when enhancing the interfacial adhesion by using a coupling agent. As a result, good final properties of the composites were manufactured with low cost. However, a fundamental understanding of the bio-filler structure and chemical composition could be beneficial to reach their full industrial applications.},

  abstract = {The influence of water environment on the sorption characteristics of low-density polyethylene composites reinforced with short pineapple-leaf fibers (PALF/LDPE) has been studied by immersion in distilled water at 28, 50 and 70°C. The effects of fiber loading, temperature and chemical treatment on the sorption behavior are also evaluated. Water uptake is found to increase with fiber loading owing to the increased cellulose content. Weight change profiles for the composites at high temperature indicated that the diffusion is close to Fickian. All of the treated composites showed lower uptake than the unmodified composites. Parameters like diffusion, sorption and permeability coefficients were determined and activation energies were calculated. The thermodynamic constants such as entropy, enthalpy and first-order kinetic rate constant have been evaluated. A correlation between theoretical and experimental sorption results was evaluated. The effect of water uptake on uniaxial tensile properties has also been studied. Mechanical properties decreased after exposure to water, depending on time of immersion, fiber loading and chemical treatment. Finally, studies were carried out on the flexural properties of PALF/LDPE composites exposed to ultraviolet radiation.},

  abstract = {The resistance of bamboo fiber reinforced polypropylene composite (BFRP) and bamboo-glass fiber reinforced polypropylene hybrid composite (BGRP) to hygrothermal aging and their fatigue behavior under cyclic tensile load were studied. Injection molded samples were exposed in water at 25 °C for up to 6 months and at 75 °C for up to 3 months. Tensile strength and elastic modulus of BFRP and BGRP samples have shown moderate reduction after aging at 25°C after 6 months, however, they were reduced considerably after aging at 75°C for 3 months. Moisture absorption and tensile strength degradation are suppressed by using maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent in both types of composite systems. BFRP and BGRP samples were also loaded cyclically at maximum cyclic load of 35, 50, 65, and 80\% of their ultimate tensile stress. Results suggest that BGRP has better fatigue resistance than BFRP at all load levels tested.},

  abstract = {In this paper, tossa jute fibres were corona discharge and ultraviolet (UV) treated to improve the mechanical properties of natural-fibre/epoxy composites. Corona-treated fibres exhibited significantly higher polar components of the free surface energy with increasing treatment energy output. Owing to the difficulties in effective treatment of three-dimensional objects with corona discharge, the increase of polarity of treated yarns is relatively small, in comparison to the results achieved with single fibres. Furthermore a decrease in the yarn tenacity was observed with increasing corona energy level. The UV treatment of the single fibres and yarns led to significantly higher gains in polarity in comparison with those observed in relation to corona-treated materials. Increasing treatment time at a constant bulb-sample distance or alternatively decreasing the distance significantly increased the polarity and decreased yarn tenacity. To improve the overall mechanical properties of jute/epoxy composites, an appropriate balance needs to be achieved between increased polarity of fibre surface and the decrease of fibre strength subsequent to excessive surface oxidation by corona discharge or UV radiation. At the optimum treatment conditions an increase in the composite flexural strength of about 30\% was achieved.},

  abstract  = {We empirically study the performance of the particle swarm optimizer (PSO). Four different benchmark functions with asymmetric initial range settings are selected as testing functions. The experimental results illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSO. Under all the testing cases, the PSO always converges very quickly towards the optimal positions but may slow its convergence speed when it is near a minimum. Nevertheless, the experimental results show that the PSO is a promising optimization method and a new approach is suggested to improve PSO's performance near the optima, such as using an adaptive inertia weight.},

  abstract  = {Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGD-Momentum) always causes the overshoot problem due to the integral action of the momentum term. Recently, an ID optimizer is proposed to solve the overshoot problem with the help of derivative information. However, the derivative term suffers from the interference of the high-frequency noise, especially for the stochastic gradient descent method that uses minibatch data in each update step. In this work, we propose a complete PID optimizer, which weakens the effect of the D term and adds a P term to more stably alleviate the overshoot problem. To further reduce the interference of the high-frequency noise, two effective and efficient methods are proposed to stabilize the training process. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets with different scales, i.e., MNIST, Cifar10 and TinyImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed PID optimizer on various popular deep neural networks.},

  abstract    = {Despite superior training outcomes, adaptive optimization methods such as Adam, Adagrad or RMSprop have been found to generalize poorly compared to Stochastic gradient descent (SGD). These methods tend to perform well in the initial portion of training but are outperformed by SGD at later stages of training. We investigate a hybrid strategy that begins training with an adaptive method and switches to SGD when appropriate. Concretely, we propose SWATS, a simple strategy which switches from Adam to SGD when a triggering condition is satisfied. The condition we propose relates to the projection of Adam steps on the gradient subspace. By design, the monitoring process for this condition adds very little overhead and does not increase the number of hyperparameters in the optimizer. We report experiments on several standard benchmarks such as: ResNet, SENet, DenseNet and PyramidNet for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets, ResNet on the tiny-ImageNet data set and language modeling with recurrent networks on the PTB and WT2 data sets. The results show that our strategy is capable of closing the generalization gap between SGD and Adam on a majority of the tasks.},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

  abstract = {Learning to optimize has emerged as a powerful framework for various optimization and machine learning tasks. Current such "meta-optimizers" often learn in the space of continuous optimization algorithms that are point-based and uncertainty-unaware. To overcome the limitations, we propose a meta-optimizer that learns in the algorithmic space of both point-based and population-based optimization algorithms. The meta-optimizer targets at a meta-loss function consisting of both cumulative regret and entropy. Specifically, we learn and interpret the update formula through a population of LSTMs embedded with sample- and feature-level attentions. Meanwhile, we estimate the posterior directly over the global optimum and use an uncertainty measure to help guide the learning process. Empirical results over non-convex test functions and the protein-docking application demonstrate that this new meta-optimizer outperforms existing competitors.},

When dealing with highly imbalanced data, a salient drawback of existing kNN algorithms is that the class with more frequent samples tends to dominate the neighborhood of a test instance in spite of distance measurements, which leads to suboptimal classification performance on the minority class. To solve this problem, we propose CCW (class confidence weights) that uses the probability of attribute values given class labels to weight prototypes in kNN. The main advantage of CCW is that it is able to correct the inherent bias to majority class in existing kNN algorithms on any distance measurement. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments confirm our claims.},

  abstract   = {The imbalanced class problem is related to the real-world application of classification in engineering. It is characterised by a very different distribution of examples among the classes. The condition of multiple imbalanced classes is more restrictive when the aim of the final system is to obtain the most accurate precision for each of the concepts of the problem. The goal of this work is to provide a thorough experimental analysis that will allow us to determine the behaviour of the different approaches proposed in the specialised literature. First, we will make use of binarization schemes, i.e., one versus one and one versus all, in order to apply the standard approaches to solving binary class imbalanced problems. Second, we will apply several ad hoc procedures which have been designed for the scenario of imbalanced data-sets with multiple classes. This experimental study will include several well-known algorithms from the literature such as decision trees, support vector machines and instance-based learning, with the intention of obtaining global conclusions from different classification paradigms. The extracted findings will be supported by a statistical comparative analysis using more than 20 data-sets from the KEEL repository.},

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.},

  abstract = {In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

For each classification task, the study relates a set of changes in a confusion matrix to specific characteristics of data. Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier’s evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem. This formal analysis is supported by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classifiers. Text classification supplements the discussion with several case studies.},
