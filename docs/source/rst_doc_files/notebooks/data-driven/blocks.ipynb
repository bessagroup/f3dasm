    "In the `f3dasm` framework, every component of the data-driven process is encapsulated as a `Block`. A block is an object designed to work with an `ExperimentData` instance. When invoked, it processes the data within the `ExperimentData` instance and produces a new `ExperimentData` instance. By chaining different blocks, you can construct a complete data-driven pipeline."
