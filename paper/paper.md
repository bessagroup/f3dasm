# Summary
<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

The process of structural and materials design involves a continuous search for the most efficient design based on specific criteria. The varying boundary conditions applied to the material or structure can result in vastly different optimal designs. In particular, the design of material systems is faced with a high-dimensional engineering design space due to the overwhelming number of potential combinations that can create distinct materials.

Unfortunately, this extensive design space poses a significant challenge to accelerate the design process. The immense number of possibilities makes it impractical to conduct experimental investigations for each conceptual design. As a result, data-driven computational analyses have been a method of interest to explore these design spaces.

The use of state-of-the-art data-driven methods for innovative structural and materials design has demonstrated their potential in various studies [@Aage2017; @Schelling2021]. Although these specific applications may differ, the data-driven modelling and optimization process remains the same. However, a comprehensive framework for data-driven design has not yet been established in the literature. Therefore, we introduce the framework for data-driven design and analysis of structures and materials (`f3dasm`): an attempt to develop a systematic approach of inverting the material design process. 


# Statement of need
<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->


The `f3dasm` framework is aimed at researchers who seek to incorporate structures and materials modeling with modern machine learning tools in a data-driven approach. The framework integrates the following fields:

- Design of experiments, in which input variables describing the microstructure, structure, properties and external conditions of the system to be evaluated are determined and sampled.
- Data generation, typically through computational analysis, resulting in the creation of a material response database.
- Machine learning, in which a surrogate model is trained to fit experimental findings.
- Optimization, where we try to iteratively improve the model to obtain a superior design.

The package includes extensive implementation for each of the provided fields. Nevertheless, `f3dasm` is designed as a *modular* framework, consisting of both core and extended features.

The core functionality of the framework comprises the following features:

- provide a way to parametrize experiments with the design-of-experiments classes.
- enabling experiment exploration by means of sampling and design optimization.
- provide the user guidance in parallelizing their program and ordering their data.
- Allowing users to deploy experiments on high-performance computer systems (TORQUE Resource Manager).

The extensions can be installed on the fly and contain the following features:

- provide various implementations to accommodate common data-driven workflows.
- adapter classes that link popular machine learning libraries to be used as implementations in `f3dasm`.



# Coding framework

The effectiveness of the pre-released version of the `f3dasm` framework [@Bessa2017] has been demonstrated in various computational mechanics and materials studies, such as the design of a super-compressible meta-material [@Bessa2019] and a spiderweb nano-mechanical resonator inspired by nature and guided by machine learning [@Shin2022]. 

Since its creation, the code has not received any major updates and lacked active development. This presented an opportunity for growth as the original authors aim to achieve a unified framework. In order to reincarnate the framework and enhance its usability, a complete comprehensive redesign have been conducted. Key objectives that have be addressed include:

- The incorporation and abstraction of various elements of the data-driven process.
- The creation of a user-friendly and thoroughly documented code base.
- The development of an open-source platform for sharing and contributing to reproducible studies using the data-driven framework.


## Design

By abstracting away the details of specific implementations, users and developers can better organize and reuse their code, making it easier to understand, modify, and share with others. Within the `f3dasm` framework, abstraction is done in four levels:

- **block**: blocks represent the high-level stages that can be used in the framework, e.g. the submodule `f3dasm.optimization`. They incorporate a core action undertaken by the data-driven process.
- **base**: bases represent abstract classes of an element in the block, e.g. the `f3dasm.optimization.Optimizer` class. Base classes are used to create a unified interface for specific implementations.
- **implementation**: implementations are applications of a base class feature, e.g. the `f3dasm.optimization.Adam` optimizer.
- **study**: studies represent reproducible programs that uses a certain order of blocks with specific implementations in a script-like manner.

An overview of the different levels of abstraction is given in \autoref{fig:f3dasm-blocks}.

## Documentation

Code documentation is essential for facilitating the comprehension of a software
system by developers, maintainers, and users. It serves to provide information about the functionality,
structure, dependencies, and requirements of the code. To improve the usability of the f3dasm frameÂ­work,
thorough documentation has been included with the Sphinx package. Documentation for this package can be accessed
on [the homepage](https://bessagroup.github.io/F3DASM/) and will be maintained with the
latest release of the package.

##  Open-source collaborative development

The `f3dasm` framework relies on the collaborative efforts of scientists and developers to expand its capabilities. In order to ensure the quality of the code and facilitate a smooth collaborative process, it is essential to have a well-defined software development process in place. This can be achieved by maintaining strict branching policies, and incorporating comprehensive testing suites and automatic continuous integration with GitHub Workflows. These measures help to safeguard the quality of the code, making it easier for scientists and developers to work together effectively. 

The `f3dasm` framework will maintain three types of branches:

- **main branch**: the stable version of the software, intended for users of the package. Each commit is tagged with a version (e.g. `v1.0.0`), and this branch will be distributed as a Python package.
- **pull-request branches**: short-lived development branches for each development cycle (e.g. `pr/v1.1.0`), intended for active development. At the end of each development cycle, an attempt is made to merge the pull-request branch with the main branch.
- **feature branches**: working branches intended for implementing individual features or resolving issues/bugs.

\autoref{fig:gitbranching} illustrates the branching tree of the version control strategy.

![Illustration of the version control branching strategy. Different pull-request checks are done at certain merging procedures, ensuring that the main branch will remain stable.\label{fig:gitbranching}](f3dasm-gitbranching.png)

To maintain the integrity of the framework, various (automatic) validation procedures are implemented during the merging procedure of various branches.

# Availability

`f3dasm` and its extensions are available as a `pip` package and is compatible with Python 3.8 to 3.10 and all major operating systems (Linux, MacOS and Windows). Detailed installation instructions can be found on the ['Getting Started'](https://bessagroup.github.io/F3DASM/) documentation page.
