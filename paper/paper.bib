  abstract = {Algorithmic optimization is a viable tool for solving complex materials engineering issues. In this study, a data-scarce Bayesian optimization model was developed to research the composition of bio-based composites. The proof-of-concept program adjusts the natural materials' weight ratios to optimize towards user-defined mechanical properties. Preliminary results show that the bio-composites proposed by the program had improved properties compared to existing bulk-moulding compounds. However, the algorithm choice is often arbitrary or based on anecdotal evidence. In parallel, this thesis proposed a data-driven framework for general data-scarce optimization problems to adapt the meta-heuristic during optimization. Guided by the 'No Free Lunch' theorem, we verified that the effectiveness over a selection of algorithms is dependent on problem-specific features and convergence. This effectiveness was captured in a unique identifier metric by optimizing a generated training set of optimization problems. The average solution quality was improved by combining several meta-heuristics in series, based on these problem-specifics. During the optimization of problems in the testing set, the same unique identifier was constructed at predefined stages in the optimization process. Subsequently, the problem was classified, and the meta-heuristic was adapted to the best-performing algorithm based on similar training samples. Experiments with various classifiers and a different number of predefined assessment stages were performed. Results show that the data-driven heuristic decision strategy outperformed the individual optimizers on the testing set. Despite the use of binarization techniques, the classification accuracy was heavily influenced by the imbalanced training set. In terms of computational resources, the various adaptions of the data-driven heuristic strategy are 2.5 times faster in runtime compared to the best-performing meta-heuristic Bayesian Optimization. Lastly, the framework was benchmarked against the 'learning to optimize' study and shows excellent performance on the logistic regression problem compared to the autonomous optimizer. In conclusion, it has been shown that even with the limited information of black-box optimization problems, data-driven optimization effectively improves the current standard of materials engineering processes.},

  abstract = {A new data-driven computational framework is developed to assist in the design and modeling of new material systems and structures. The proposed framework integrates three general steps: (1) design of experiments, where the input variables describing material geometry (microstructure), phase properties and external conditions are sampled; (2) efficient computational analyses of each design sample, leading to the creation of a material response database; and (3) machine learning applied to this database to obtain a new design or response model. In addition, the authors address the longstanding challenge of developing a data-driven approach applicable to problems that involve unacceptable computational expense when solved by standard analysis methods – e.g. finite element analysis of representative volume elements involving plasticity and damage. In these cases the framework includes the recently developed “self-consistent clustering analysis” method in order to build large databases suitable for machine learning. The authors believe that this will open new avenues to finding innovative materials with new capabilities in an era of high-throughput computing (“big-data”).},

  abstract = {Designing future-proof materials goes beyond a quest for the best. The next generation of materials needs to be adaptive, multipurpose, and tunable. This is not possible by following the traditional experimentally guided trial-and-error process, as this limits the search for untapped regions of the solution space. Here, a computational data-driven approach is followed for exploring a new metamaterial concept and adapting it to different target properties, choice of base materials, length scales, and manufacturing processes. Guided by Bayesian machine learning, two designs are fabricated at different length scales that transform brittle polymers into lightweight, recoverable, and supercompressible metamaterials. The macroscale design is tuned for maximum compressibility, achieving strains beyond 94% and recoverable strengths around 0.1 kPa, while the microscale design reaches recoverable strengths beyond 100 kPa and strains around 80%. The data-driven code is available to facilitate future design and analysis of metamaterials and structures (https://github.com/mabessa/F3DAS).},
