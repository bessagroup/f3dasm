    "### System requirements\n",
    "The first release of `f3dasm` **should**:\n",
    "1. comply to the Bessa Group code of conduct\n",
    "2. compatible with Python 3.7 to 3.10\n",
    "3. compatible with the three major operations system (Linux, MacOS, Ubuntu)\n",
    "4. available as a `pip` install\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature requirements\n",
    "The first release of `f3dasm` should:\n",
    "1. have a way to parametrize a **design-of-experiments** from their own program\n",
    "2. give the user the option to **sample** and **optimize** from their design with various optimizers\n",
    "3. give the user guidance in **parallelizing** and ordering their experiment-data\n",
    "4. provide high-level classes to deploy **simulations**.\n",
    "4. give the user ways of deploying their **experiment** at the HPC (TORQUE system)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first release of `f3dasm` **should not**:\n",

    "- the **developement** package: contains the full installation plus requirements for developing on `f3dasm`. Installed with `pip install f3dasm[dev]`\n",

    "The following extensions are available:\n",
    "- **machinelearning**: containing various `tensorflow` related models\n",
    "- **sampling**: containing sampling strategies from `SALib`\n",
